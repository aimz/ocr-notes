A small Android project done by relatively small people. The idea is to create an an app that let's
 you create and organize notes. The project consists of two major parts:

The website
The Android app

User creates an account in the website using his facebook account.

The Android app let's you take pictures, and using an OCR engine, it extracts text from the picture.
You can also type the notes manually. Afterwhich, you are then given the option to make a PDF or
txt file from the extracted text/text, and the option to upload it to your profile in the website.
You can also download notes from your profile to your phone, in case you deleted your local copy
(phone copy).

When the user signs in through the website, he can view, edit, and comment on his notes.

The website will be written in Ruby on Rails with SQLite as the backend db for easy data transfer
between the phone and the site.

We will (most likely) be using Aspire OCR engine. (Best documentation so far)

Git for version control.
